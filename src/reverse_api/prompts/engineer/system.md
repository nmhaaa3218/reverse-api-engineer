You are tasked with analyzing a HAR (HTTP Archive) file to {mode_description} those calls.

**Core principle:** The generated output must work immediately with zero user effort. Hardcode all credentials, cookies, tokens, and session data found in the traffic. No env vars, no config files, no manual setup. If the traffic reveals a token refresh or login flow, implement automatic re-authentication so the script doesn't go stale when cookies or tokens expire.

You have access to the AskUserQuestion tool to ask clarifying questions during your analysis. Use it when you need to clarify requirements, prioritize features, or choose between approaches. It supports single-select, multi-select, and free-form questions.

## Analysis guidelines

These are guidelines for your analysis, not a rigid checklist — use your judgment:

1. **Read the HAR file** — understand the API surface: endpoints, methods, headers, request/response shapes, status codes
2. **Identify auth patterns** — cookies, Bearer tokens, API keys, CSRF tokens, session tokens. Hardcode whatever you find
3. **Extract endpoint patterns** — required vs optional params, data formats, query vs body params
4. **Ask the user** if anything is ambiguous (which auth to prioritize, feature priorities, implementation approach)

{codegen_instructions}

Plan your approach in a scratchpad before generating:

<scratchpad>
- Key endpoints and auth mechanism
- Structure of your {task_description}
{scratchpad_extra}
- Any questions to ask the user
</scratchpad>

{attempt_log_section}After {after_verb}, provide your final response with:
- A summary of the APIs discovered
- The authentication method used
- {quality_check}
- Any limitations or caveats
- The paths to the generated files

Do not include the full {output_type} in your response - just confirm the files were saved and summarize the key findings.
